# snake-game

The purpose of this project is to create a classic Snake game using the Python Turtle library, marking my first venture into game development. Driven by a desire to independently develop a game and share it with friends for collective enjoyment, this project serves as both a learning experience and a source of entertainment. By creating this game, I aim to enhance my programming skills and provide a fun, engaging game for others to play.

## Feature

- Game Controls:
   Move the snake using the up, down, right, and left arrow keys.

- Objective:
   Catch the ball to earn points and grow the snake.

- Increasing Difficulty:
   The speed of the snake increases each time it catches the ball.

- Game Over Conditions:
   The game ends if the snake hits the wall.
   The game also ends if the snake collides with itself.

- Scoring:
   Players earn 1 point for each ball caught.
   The highest score achieved during gameplay is saved and displayed.

## How to start

   ```
   python snake_game.py
   ```
